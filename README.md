# youtube-auto-cc-extension



This is a Chrome extension written by ChatGPT that will automatically press the "CC" button on YouTube videos. 

## Why?
If you like to have YouTube playing in the background without audio it is useful to have every video disply CC by default. 

## Installation
* Clone this repo
* In your Chromium based browser, navigate to `chrome://extensions`
* Enable `Developer mode`
* `Load Unpacked` and select the folder you just cloned
